0.4 - Release Version
	Added Collectors:
		moncoll
		jsoncgicoll

	Added Tools:
		gnhastweb
		gtk-insteonedit (partially complete)

	Added Commands:
		cfeed
		setalarm
		dumpalarms
		listenalarms
		ping
		imalive
	
	New Features:

	Support for new style insteon HUBs.

	Collectors now have self-health checks, and gnhastd monitors them.  A
	collector will be flagged as bad if it doesn't send updates, or fails
	to respond to "pings".  This can help with certain devices that get
	wedged up after awhile, or collectors that die off mysteriously.

	moncoll collector is a special collector that interfaces with the
	collector devices created on the gnhast server, and when a collector
	is marked bad, it can restart the collector, forcibly if needed.

	cfeed is a new type of feed to monitor switches.  Unlike the usual
	timed feed, cfeed will notify the listeners immediately upon change.

	Add an alarm subsystem.  This is very basic.  Each alarm has a
	user-generated uid, a blob of text, and an arbitrary severity number.
	This can be used by scripts to post generic alarms to other things.
	Currently nothing uses this, eventually the web interface will be
	made aware of it.

	gtk-insteonedit is a tool to allow link editing of insteon devices
	directly.  It is still partially complete.

	gnhastweb is a full fledged web GUI for gnhast.  It allows basic
	editing of devices, and placing devices into groups.  However, what
	it is actually designed for, is to give you a tablet/phone based
	control panel for your house.  Each device is a small "card" on the UI,
	and you can interact with them.  They are dynamically updated with the
	current status, and you can do things like flip switches on and off,
	adjust dimmers, etc.  It can also interface with your rrd files
	generated by rrdcoll to display simple graphs of sensor data.  The
	interface is completely configurable via conf file.  You can even
	substitute hand-generated html for some, or all of the groups, to do
	something like use an image map of your house as the navigation.  More
	documentation on this will need to be provided.
	
0.3 - Release Version (never actually released, sorry)
	Add SIGUSR1 handling to all collectors (flip debug mode switch)
	Add rpm spec file	

0.2.4 - Development Version
	Added Collectors:
		ad2usbcoll
		icaddycoll
		venstarcall
		gtk-gnhast
	
	Added Handlers:
		timer
		timer2

	Added Tools:
		ssdp_scan
		modhargs
		addhandler
		notify_listen
		venstar_stats

	New Features:

	Added gtk-gnhast. A gtk2 application that allows for easy overview and
	editing of your setup.  Designed to make creation of groups easier.
	
	Fully flesh out group system.  Now devices can be members of groups,
	as well as groups being members of other groups.

	New command "regg" to register a group.

	New command "lgrps" to list groups.

	Add venstar_stats script, to pull daily usage data off the venstar and
	save to an rrd.  This doesn't fit well with the general gnhastd
	concept, so did it as an extra. (only useful for graphing).

	Add Venstar T5900/T5800 collector for Venstar Thermostats.

	Added http and jsmn helper routines to ease coding of future
	http/json stuff.

	Add icaddycoll, the collector for the IrrigationCaddy. Can read status
	of valves, programs, and run individual valves or programs.

	Add ssdp_scan and notify_listen.  Simple tools to view SSDP and UPNP
	data on the network, and see what is out there.

	Imported jsmn from: http://zserge.bitbucket.org

	More Insteon fixes, change the way groups work in the insteon tools.

	Added automatic reset code to the brultech collector.  If it detects
	a hang condition, will automatically connect to the wiznet device and
	reset it.

	Add tools directory.  Add modhargs and addhandler, simple scripts to
	patch a handler or hargs into a running gnhast instance.

	Add example timer scripts, timer and timer2, for setting a light on
	for a given time when a condition occurs.

	Add ad2usbcoll collector for the NuTech AD2USB device.  Interfaces
	with Honeywell Vista alarms, and allows reading of alarm states.

	Added new subtypes, alarmstatus, number, percentage,
	thmode (thermostat mode), smnumber (small number), flowrate, distance,
	volume (sound).

0.2.3 - Release 7/9/13
    	Added Collectors:
		wupwscoll
		wmr918coll
	Added Handlers:
		nightlight
		switchon
		switchoff
    	New features:
	
	Make gnhastd aware of the unit that data is stored in.
	Now a collector tells gnhast what scale it is feeding data in
	(ex, Celcius). When requesting data, you can request it in a
	different scale, and the server will auto-caclulate.
	
	Add a wupwscoll collector.  This collector will publish weather data
	to weather underground, and pwsweather.com.
	
	Add wmr918coll collector.  Collects data from oregon scientific
	weather stations. Works on wx200's wmr918's, and can also connect to
	a running wx200d instance and gather data from that.
	
	Insteon i2cs code now tested and working fully.
	
	Added basic handlers for a nightlight routine, and switching devices
	on and off.
	
	Add a modify command to gnhastd, so you can edit the config file on
	the fly by sending it simple commands.  This allows you to add a
	handler or tweak names/watermarks on a running instance.
	
	Port to Linux.

0.2 - Initial Release 5/29/13
