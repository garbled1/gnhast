    Added Collectors:
	wupwscoll
	wmr918coll
    Added Handlers:
	nightlight
	switchon
	switchoff
    New features:
	Make gnhastd aware of the unit that data is stored in.  Now a collector tells
gnhast what scale it is feeding data in (ex, Celcius). When requesting data, you can
request it in a different scale, and the server will auto-caclulate.
	Add a wupwscoll collector.  This collector will publish weather data to
weather underground, and pwsweather.com.
	Add wmr918coll collector.  Collects data from oregon scientific weather stations.
Works on wx200's wmr918's, and can also connect to a running wx200d instance and
gather data from that.
	Insteon i2cs code now tested and working fully.
	Added basic handlers for a nightlight routine, and switching devices on and off.
	Add a modify command to gnhastd, so you can edit the config file on the fly by
sending it simple commands.  This allows you to add a handler or tweak names/watermarks
on a running instance.
