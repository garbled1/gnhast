# Balboa SPA collector #

## Quick Start ##

./balboacoll -m /tmp/new.conf

Edit the conf file as desired, (change names, etc), install to
/usr/local/etc/balboacoll.conf, then start the collector.

The collector does an SSDP scan of your network for balboa devices.  If you
have two spas (really?) this will not work.  I didn't really plan for that..

Email me and I'll fix it.  But really.  You have TWO spas?
