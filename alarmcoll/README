If the temp sensor TempSensor goes above 80 degrees (in the native format)
set an alarm of type POWER with a severity of 1.

Dimmer,J,3,1,AC_dimmerJ,"The dimmer is not moving",0.0,300

If the device "Dimmer" does not change for 300 seconds or more, set an alarm
of type POWER with a severity of 5

Switch,=,10,1,AC_switchon,"The switch is ON",1

If the device "Switch" is set to "1" (on) set an alarm of type POWER with a
severity of 10.
